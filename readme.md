# Learn-to-Earn Streaming Platform

## Project Tokens
The platform uses **LearnToEarn Tokens (LTE)** to facilitate payments for one-on-one tutoring sessions. These tokens are built on the Ethereum blockchain and follow the ERC-20 standard for compatibility with wallets and exchanges.

## Project Description
Learn-to-Earn is an innovative streaming platform where users can connect with expert tutors and instructors for one-on-one live sessions. The platform empowers users to learn at their own pace while instructors earn tokens for their expertise. Using blockchain technology, we ensure secure and transparent transactions, making education more accessible and rewarding.

*Key Objectives:*
- *Decentralization*: Empower students and tutors to interact without intermediaries, creating a peer-to-peer ecosystem.
- *Transparency and Security*: All tutoring sessions and payments are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
- *Access to Education*: Make quality tutoring services available globally, allowing tutors to offer their services and students to find help in a decentralized and trustless environment.
- *Automation*: Smart contracts handle everything automatically, ensuring smooth transactions and eliminating human errors or fraud.

## Key Features

- *Tutor Registration*: Tutors can sign up by specifying their subject, hourly rate, and available hours. Once registered, they can be found by students looking for tutoring in those subjects.
  
- *Student Registration*: Students can register by specifying the subject they need tutoring in and the number of hours they require. The system automatically calculates the total cost of tutoring.
  
- *Session Management*: Tutors and students can start and end tutoring sessions with simple calls to the smart contract, marking the session as in-progress or completed.
  
- *Automated Payment Handling*: Payments are automatically transferred to the tutor once a tutoring session is started. This ensures both the tutor and student are committed before the service is provided.
  
- *Blockchain-Based Transparency*: All sessions, payments, and interactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing full transparency for all parties involved.
  
- *Security and Trust*: Smart contracts ensure that the terms of the agreement are met, including payment and availability, reducing the risk of fraud or misunderstandings.
  
- *Availability Status*: Tutors can set their availability status to "available" or "unavailable" to make it clear when they are ready to offer their services.

---### Future Improvements

- *Rating and Feedback System*: After a session ends, students and tutors can rate each other, helping to build trust and improve the quality of the platform.
- *Dispute Resolution*: Implement a mechanism for resolving disputes between tutors and students (e.g., through arbitration or community voting).
- *Extended Functionality*: Add additional features like scheduling, group tutoring, and subscriptionÂ models.
